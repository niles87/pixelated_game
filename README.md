## Suggested Use

To play the game without cloning it to your local machine [click here](https://niles87.github.io/pixelated_game/ "Pixelated Game Link").
Since the canvas size isn't based on the windows inner width I would suggest only using it when a screen size of more than 800px is possible.
To control the player use the direction pad on your keyboard.

### Future Updates

- A landing page to allow login and authentication to save progress of for each user, after moving to a cloud host.
- More than one level/backdrop.
- A timer to control the length of time for each level.
- Instead of just collision between the player and npcs use a "blaster" to eliminate npcs.
